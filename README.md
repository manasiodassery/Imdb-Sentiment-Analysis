Project Overview

IMDb Sentiment Analysis is a machine learning project aimed at classifying the sentiment of movie reviews as positive or negative. This project utilizes natural language processing techniques to preprocess text data and deep learning models to predict sentiments. The analysis is performed on a dataset comprising movie reviews from IMDb.


Features

Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, padding, and encoding of text data.
Model Building: Use of LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM networks to capture the context of the text effectively.
Training and Evaluation: Models are trained and evaluated using accuracy metrics, and their performance is visualized through loss and accuracy plots.
Experiment Tracking: Integration with Weights & Biases for tracking experiments, comparing different runs, and visualizing metrics.


Models

Details about the models used, including architecture and hyperparameters:
LSTM Model: Layers, neurons, activation functions, optimizer, and loss function.
Bidirectional LSTM Model: Specific configurations and enhancements over the basic LSTM model.


Results
